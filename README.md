# MediSphere - Disease Diagnosis
### MediSphere is a web application that diagnose disease using machine learning model based on the symptoms that the user enters.
[Website Link](https://we-project-disease-predictor.herokuapp.com/)
* We diagnose the disease if the patient is not in danger and the user simply wants to know what disease he or she might have.
* The dataset consisting of at least 100 symptoms, is used to train the model to diagnose various diseases.
* The web application provides latest health related news from all over the world.
* It also provide information of nearby healthcare center to the user along with emergency helpline numbers.
* The website provides information such as causes, symptoms and prevention related to common diseases. 
* It includes yoga instruction for preventing some of the most common ailments.
